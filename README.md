# Chatbot-openai
This chatbot is created using Python and the OpenAI and Streamlit libraries

The chatbot is powered by the GPT-3 text-davinci-003 model and allows users to communicate with it by entering prompts in a text input field and receiving responses generated by the OpenAI API. The chat history is stored in the Streamlit session state and displayed in a chat window for the user to view.
